<h3>About Me</h3>
<a href="/about_me/picture.html"><img src="/assets/media/profile.jpg" /></a>
<p>Hello, I'm Ryan and this is my little site.</p>
<h4>WIP</h4>
<!--<h4>Show me what ya got</h4>
<p>Put the rick and morty meme so people know you're smort</p>
<p>On this site you'll find most of the public projects I've worked on as well as some dabblings I work on from time to time. Maybe there will be a "blog" or maybe the perpetual dread of strangers on the internet reading what I write will nix that idea from my head. It's anyone's guess really.</p>
<h5>Where's the projects?</h5>
<a href="/projects">Here!</a>
<p>Getting my projects centralized in one place was the main focus behind this site, but I also do enjoy hurting myself with web development.</p>
<h5>Where's the blog?</h5>
<a href="/">Here, I guess</a>
<h4>What would you say you do here?</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4OvQIGDg4I" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/media/what_do_you_say_you_do_here.jpg" /></a>
<p>I'm a software developer working on native <a href="https://digital.ai/application-protection" target="_blank">application protection</a> at <a href='https://digital.ai/' target='_blank'>digital.ai</a>, but, in my spare time, I also work on my life-long goal of finishing <i>a project</i>.</p>
<h4>Social Links?</h4>
<p>All of my projects are hosted on github, or at least, some form of them are; so, if you want to look at my crappy code, go there. I'm also periodically active on Twitter from time-to-time. Sometimes I post a knee-slapper.</p>
